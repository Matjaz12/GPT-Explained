# Building a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)

![transformer](./img/transformer.jpg)


## About

In this notebook, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation by implementing a decoder-only Transformer model for character-level prediction. The majority of the code used in this project has been sourced from [1], while the theoretical insights have been taken from various sources including [2], [3], [4], [5]. Additionally, illustrations used in this notebook are taken from the "Attention is all you need" paper [6].

Notebook: [Generative Pre-trained Transformer](./GPT.ipynb)

## Results

We train the model to predict the next character on the tinyshakespear dataset [7], the following figure shows the Cross Entropy Loss
after 5000 epochs (the model was trained for roughly 5 minutes on google colab). The text bellow shows characters generated by the trained model.
